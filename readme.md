# NFL Predictor :football:

NFL Predictor is a work-in-progress project by Katherine Gan and David Sun that uses [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape over the last twenty years and create a machine learning model that predicts NFL games.

It aims to:

-   Predict the outcome of an NFL game with higher than 75% accuracy (tentatively)
-   Generate a power ranking based on team performance for the current season _or for the next season_
-   Produce projections for every team's win-loss count and playoff percentage for the current season _or for the next season_

On the horizon:

-   Predict individual players' statistics
-   Produce projections for every player's estimated fantasy points for the week or the season
-   Create reasonable trades for every team
-   Feed the model using Twitter (take football fans' predictions and use them to better predict games)
